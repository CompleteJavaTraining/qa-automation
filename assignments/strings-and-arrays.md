## Problem Statement

Your task is to implement a program that can perform various string and array operations.

### Part 1: String Operations

1. Write a method `reverseString` that takes a `String` as input and returns the reverse of that string. For example, if the input string is `"hello"`, the output should be `"olleh"`.

2. Write a method `isPalindrome` that takes a `String` as input and returns `true` if the input string is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. For example, `"racecar"` is a palindrome, but `"hello"` is not.

3. Write a method `countVowels` that takes a `String` as input and returns the number of vowels in the input string. For the purposes of this assignment, assume that the English vowels are `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`. For example, if the input string is `"hello"`, the output should be `2`.

### Part 2: Array Operations

1. Write a method `findLargest` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the largest integer in the array.

2. Write a method `reverseArray` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the reverse of that array. For example, if the input array is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, the output should be `{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`.

3. Write a method `removeDuplicates` that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array that contains only the unique elements of the input array. For example, if the input array is `{1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5}`, the output should be `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.

### Part 3: Main Program

Write a main program that prompts the user to select an operation (string or array), and then performs the selected operation based on user input. The program should continue prompting the user for input until the user chooses to quit.

## Requirements

- Your program must compile and run without errors.
- You must use the Java programming language.
- You may not use any external libraries or frameworks.
- You must implement all of the required methods as specified above.
- You must implement a main program that allows the user to select an operation and performs the selected operation based on user input.
- Your code must be well-organized and easy to read.
- Your code must include comments that describe the purpose of each method and major block of code.
