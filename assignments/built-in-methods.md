## Problem Statement

Your task is to implement a program that demonstrates your understanding of built-in methods in Java related to strings, arrays, numbers and characters.

### Part 1: String Methods

1. Write a method `countVowels` that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.

2. Write a method `countConsonants` that takes a string as input and returns the number of consonants in the string.

3. Write a method `reverseString` that takes a string as input and returns a new string that is the reverse of the input string.

### Part 2: Array Methods

1. Write a method `findAverage` that takes an array of integers as input and returns their average.

2. Write a method `findMax` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the largest element in the array.

3. Write a method `rotateArray` that takes an array of integers and an integer `k` as input and returns a new array where the elements are rotated k positions to the right. For example, if the input array is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and k is 2, the output should be {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}.

### Part 3: Number Methods

1. Write a method `isPrime` that takes an integer as input and returns `true` if the input is prime, and `false` otherwise.

2. Write a method `findFactorial` that takes an integer as input and returns its factorial.

3. Write a method `findNthFibonacci` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence.

### Part 4: Character Methods

1. Write a method `countUpperCaseLetters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of uppercase letters in the string.

2. Write a method `countLowerCaseLetters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of lowercase letters in the string.

3. Write a method `isDigit` that takes a character as input and returns `true` if the input is a digit, and `false` otherwise.

### Part 5: Main Program

Write a main program that prompts the user to select an operation (string, array, number or character), and then performs the selected operation based on user input. The program should continue prompting the user for input until the user chooses to quit.

## Requirements

- Your program must compile and run without errors.
- You must use the Java programming language.
- You may not use any external libraries or frameworks.
- You must implement all of the required methods as specified above.
- You must implement a main program that allows the user to select an operation and performs the selected operation based on user input.
- Your code must be well-organized and easy to read.
- Your code must include comments that describe the purpose of each method and major block of code.
