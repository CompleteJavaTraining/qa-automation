## Problem Statement

Your task is to implement a program that demonstrates your understanding of user-defined methods in Java.

### Part 1: Basic Methods

1. Write a method `greet` that takes a name as input and prints a greeting message to the console. The message should be in the following format: "Hello, [name]!" For example, if the input is "Alice", the output should be "Hello, Alice!".

2. Write a method `sum` that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

3. Write a method `isPrime` that takes an integer as input and returns `true` if the input is prime, and `false` otherwise.

### Part 2: Array Methods

1. Write a method `average` that takes an array of integers as input and returns their average.

2. Write a method `findMax` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the largest element in the array.

3. Write a method `reverse` that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array that is the reverse of the input array.

### Part 3: String Methods

1. Write a method `countWords` that takes a string as input and returns the number of words in the string. For the purposes of this assignment, a word is any sequence of characters separated by whitespace.

2. Write a method `reverseWords` that takes a string as input and returns a new string where the order of the words is reversed. For example, if the input is "Hello world", the output should be "world Hello".

3. Write a method `isPalindrome` that takes a string as input and returns `true` if the input is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise. For the purposes of this assignment, a palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards.

### Part 4: Main Program

Write a main program that prompts the user to select an operation (basic, array, or string), and then performs the selected operation based on user input. The program should continue prompting the user for input until the user chooses to quit.

## Requirements

- Your program must compile and run without errors.
- You must use the Java programming language.
- You may not use any external libraries or frameworks.
- You must implement all of the required methods as specified above.
- You must implement a main program that allows the user to select an operation and performs the selected operation based on user input.
- Your code must be well-organized and easy to read.
- Your code must include comments that describe the purpose of each method and major block of code.
