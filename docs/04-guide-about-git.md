# Git and GitHub Guide for Students

This guide is designed for students who are just getting started with writing code and have never used any version control system. We will cover the basics of Git and GitHub to help you understand and manage your code effectively.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your codebase. It is an essential tool for software development and collaboration.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing and collaborating on Git repositories. GitHub also offers additional features, such as issue tracking, project management, and code review.

## Installing Git

1. Visit the official Git download page: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Download and install the appropriate Git package for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

## Setting up Git

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or Git Bash on Windows) and configure your Git user name and email address with the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
Replace "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your actual name and email address.

## Creating a Git Repository

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to create a new Git repository.

2. Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

3. Add your files to the repository with the following command:

```bash
git add .
```

The `.` (dot) represents all files in the current directory.

4. Commit your changes with the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```


Replace "Initial commit" with a meaningful commit message that describes your changes.

## Using GitHub

1. Sign up for a free GitHub account at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).

2. Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking the "+" icon in the upper-right corner and selecting "New repository".

3. Give your repository a name, set it to "Public" or "Private", and click "Create repository".

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to push your local Git repository to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace "yourusername" and "yourrepository" with your GitHub username and repository name.

## Cloning a GitHub Repository

1. Go to the GitHub repository you want to clone.

2. Click the "Code" button and copy the repository's URL.

3. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

Replace "https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git" with the URL you copied earlier.

## Basic Git Workflow

1. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git pull
```

2. Make changes to your code and stage them for a new commit:

```bash
git add .
```

3. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

4. Push your changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push
```

5. Repeat steps 1-4 as you make more changes to your code.
